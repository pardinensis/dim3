# - Locate SDL2 library (Modified version of FindSDL.cmake from cmake 2.8.11.2)
# This module defines
#  SDL2_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
#  SDL2_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL2
#  SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
#  SDL2_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the version of SDL2
#
# Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL2_LIBRARY_TEMP in your configuration
# and no SDL2_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL2 library
# (SDL2.dll, libsdl2.so, SDL2.framework, etc).
# Set SDL2_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL2 library, and configure again.
# Similarly, if you see an empty SDL2MAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value
# as appropriate. These values are used to generate the final SDL2_LIBRARY
# variable, but when these values are unset, SDL2_LIBRARY does not get created.
#
#
# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR
# used in building SDL2.
# l.e.galup  9-20-02
#
# Modified by Eric Wing.
# Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables
# and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
# Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL guidelines.
# Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some platforms.
# Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms.
# Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of
# SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention
# is #include "SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>. This is done for portability
# reasons because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).
